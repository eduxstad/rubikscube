#Rubiks Cube Solver by using Neural Networks

Solve a Rubiks Cube with a Neural Network. First, change the scramble number to a lower value such a 4 or 5, then generate the neural network (open the console to view progress) then you can use neural scramble and then neural solve to see the neural net in action!

Thanks to Pithon3 for his help and ligangwang for his web cube.

# Rubik's Cube and its Solvers

This is a 3D 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube written in Javascript for Web and Mobile.
Cordova is used in developing the Rubik's cube application with cross-platform (Web/Android/iOS) support.

## It features:
* Input initial position using Singmaster positional notation
* Rotate on unfolded 2D surface and folded 3D cube
* Implement [beginner's layer by layer solving method](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/) for cube learners
* Support rotation using command or mouse or touch screen
* Support using camera to input initial cube position (ongoing...)
